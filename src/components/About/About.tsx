        <p className={'about__desc'}>Vernal Bloom is a Ukrainian artist based in London.</p>
        <p className={'about__desc'}> Her bold, minimal style – often described as Pop Art meets OpArt – is
            a striking lesson in the use of positive/negative space and colour.</p>
        <p className={'about__desc'}> Her unmistakable style has established her as one of the UK’s most
            sought after graphic artists. Vernal Bloom’s clients include The New Yorker, Vogue, BAFTA,
            Sephora and Penguin Books, amongst many others.</p>
